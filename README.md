# Educational Data Mining
This repository contains data mining on the information of whole Iranian students.
I examined students' information and obtained reasons for academic growth, academic failure, and dropout.

## Dropping Out of School
I investigated the critical levels of dropping out of school and factors which have effect on it. Consequently, you can see the results in *LeavingSchool.ipynb* file. To cite an example, GPA has the most effect on dropping out of school. The following image indicates the relation between students' GPA and dropping out of school.

By considering the image, NME means need more effect, ACC stands for acceptable, GOO means good and VGO means very good.

## Expelled From School
You can also find the relation between expelled from school and other factors such as students' GPA, father's job etc. in *FiredFromSchool.ipynb* file. In Addition, in this file it has been shown which factors have the most effect on being expelled from school.

## GPA Prediction
In both *BalanceAveragePredict_Grade9.ipynb* and *BalanceAveragePredict_Adulthood.ipynb* I reported the results of GPA prediction for grade 9 students and adult students, respectively. Therefore, in GPA prediction for grade 9 students, the best prediction accuracy was achieved by **Na√Øve Bayes** which is **0.656** with **0.653 F1 score**.
