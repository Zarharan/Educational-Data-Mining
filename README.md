# Educational Data Mining
This repository contains data mining on the information of whole Iranian students.
I examined students' information and obtaining reasons for academic growth, academic failure, and dropout.

## Dropping Out of School
I investigated the critical levels of dropping out of school and the factors which have effect on it. Consequently, you can see the results in *LeavingSchool.ipynb* file. To cite an example, GPA has the most effects on dropping out of school. The following image indicates the relation between students' GPA and dropping out of school.

By considering the image, NME means need more effect, ACC stands for acceptable, GOO means good and VGO means very good.

## Fired From School
You can also find the relation between fired from school and other factors such as students' GPA, father job and etc in *FiredFromSchool.ipynb* file. In Addition, in this file it had been shown which factors have most effect on fired from school.

## GPA Prediction
In both *BalanceAveragePredict_Grade9.ipynb* and *BalanceAveragePredict_Adulthood.ipynb* I reported the result of GPA prediction for grade 9 students and adulthood students, respectively.
