This repository contains data mining on the information of whole Iranian students.
I examined students' information and obtaining reasons for academic growth, academic failure, and dropout.

## Dropping Out of School
I investigated the critical levels of dropping out of school and the factors which have effect on it. Consequently, you can see the results in *LeavingSchool.ipynb* file. To cite an example, GPA has the most effects on dropping out of school. The following image indicates the relation between students' GPA and dropping out of school.
